# Portfolio Website

## Project Overview

This is a full-stack portfolio website built using the **MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). The site showcases my personal profile, including a professional description, educational background, portfolio of projects, and a contact form through which visitors can reach out directly. When a user submits a contact form, they receive an automatic confirmation email, ensuring that their message was successfully received.

The portfolio is designed to offer potential employers, collaborators, and clients an in-depth look at my skills, achievements, and experience in web development. It is responsive, user-friendly, and optimized for seamless navigation and fast loading across all devices.
